# Low-Code and No-Code Contributions

The Django India community welcomes contributions from people of all skill levels. We believe that low-code and no-code contributions can empower individuals to contribute to open-source projects, even without extensive or no programming experience. This document will be used to record all type of contributions that lie under the category of low or no code contribution.
